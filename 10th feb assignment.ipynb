    "\n",
    "Read Mode ('r'): This is the default mode. It opens the file for reading. If the file does not exist or cannot be opened for any reason, it raises a FileNotFoundError. This mode allows you to read the contents of the file, but you cannot write or modify the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write Mode ('w'): This mode opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, it is truncated (i.e., its contents are deleted) and a new empty file is created. If the file does not exist, a new empty file is created. You can write data to the file using methods like write().\n",
    "\n",
    "Append Mode ('a'): This mode opens the file for appending. If the file already exists, new data is written at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, a new empty file is created. You can use methods like write() to append data to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read and Write Mode ('r+'): This mode opens the file for both reading and writing. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. You can read from and write to the file using methods like read(), write(), seek(), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write and Read Mode ('w+'): This mode opens the file for reading and writing. If the file already exists, its contents are truncated and a new empty file is created. If the file does not exist, a new empty file is created. You can read from and write to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Append and Read Mode ('a+'): This mode opens the file for reading and appending. The file pointer is placed at the end of the file. You can read from and append data to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary Mode ('b'): This mode is used in conjunction with other modes to indicate that the file should be opened in binary mode. For example, 'rb' indicates reading a binary file, 'wb' indicates writing a binary file, and so on. Binary mode is used to handle non-text files like images, audio, video, etc."

    "The close() function in Python is used to close a file object. It's important to close a file after you've finished using it for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Management: When you open a file in Python, the operating system allocates resources (such as file handles) to the file object. If you keep files open unnecessarily, you may exhaust system resources, especially if you're working with a large number of files or running a long-lived application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integrity: Closing a file ensures that all data that was buffered (i.e., temporarily stored in memory) is written to the file before it's closed. If you don't close a file properly, changes you made to the file might not be saved, leading to data loss or corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "File Locking: On some operating systems, files may be locked when they are opened, preventing other processes from accessing or modifying them. Closing the file releases the lock, allowing other processes to work with the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good Programming Practice: Closing files when you're done with them is considered good programming practice. It helps keep your code clean and organized, and makes it easier to manage resources."
